I would like to thank 

My adviser, for guiding me through this daunting process. \par

My family, for loving me more than anything. You were, and will always be, my home and my anchor through it all. \par

Ioana, for always being the magical intervention in my life. I love and admire your spirit, and I would poster with you anytime, anywhere. \par

Izzy, for being my unconditional friend, my little piece of Rio and one of the most beautifully inspiring human beings I know. \par

Cezar, for being my Pushnik, my spontaneity and my spoiled. I'm lucky to have jumped from that airplane with you. \par

Terrace F. Club, for showing me that food is love.\par

All the encounters that made me who I am today.
