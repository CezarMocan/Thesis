I would like to thank 

My advisor, Prof. Roland Benabou, for patiently and insightfully guiding me through the thesis-writing process. \par

My family, for loving me more than anything. You were, and will always be, my home and my anchor through it all. \par

Ioana, for always being the magical intervention in my life. I love and admire your spirit, and this thesis would have not been possible without you. \par

Izzy, for being my unconditional friend, my little piece of Rio and one of the most beautifully inspiring human beings I know. 

Cezar, for being my Pushnik, my spontaneity and my strength. I'm lucky to have you in my life, and to have jumped from that airplane with you. \par

Charles Peraertz-Turcanu, and Charler Jr. for their furry presence and unconditional support. \par

Terrace F. Club and its incredible souls, for showing me that \textit{food is love}.\par

All the encounters that made me who I am today.
